.SH NAME
tls-session-tags \- TLS session tags
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/tlshd/tags.d/
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tlshd
program implements a user agent that services TLS handshake requests
on behalf of kernel TLS consumers.
Its configuration files, found under the
.I /etc/tlshd
directory, contain information that the
.B tlshd
program reads when it starts up.
The configuration files direct the
.B tlshd
program to information about which trust store and signing
and encryption algorithms are to be used.
The configuration files are considered a trusted source of information.
.P
When a peer presents an X.509 certificate during a TLS handshake, the
.B tlshd
program is responsible for verifying that the certificate was
issued by a certificate authority that the receiver recognizes and
trusts.
Once that verification is successful, the receiver can trust
the content of that certificate, including information about
the peer identity presented in that certificate (e.g., a DNS hostname
or IP address, and so on).
.P
Once a peer's certificate is trusted,
the
.B tlshd
program can be configured to scan the fields in the peer's certificate.
Based on the scan,
the
.B tlshd
program can assign tags to the new TLS session that
indicate that the server recognizes the peer's identity.
For example,
the
.B tlshd
program can be configured to look for a specific string in
.I subject
fields, and assign tags to TLS sessions where the peer presented
a certificate with matching content in that field.
Kernel consumers can use those tags to authorize or deny access
to resources based on the identity presented in peer certificates.
.P
The following sections describe how to configure this facility.
.SH FORMAT
TLS session tag definitions are YAML documents stored in files in the
.I /etc/tlshd/tags.d
directory.
When it launches, the
.B tlshd
program reads all files in that directory with either the
.I .yml
or
.I .yaml
extension.
Modifications to the content of these files take effect only when the
.B tlshd
program is restarted.
.P
The
.B tlshd
program
populates two dictionaries from the contents of these files:
.TP
.B filters
Each filter defined in this dictionary specifies the name of a
field in an X.509 certificate, and the conditions under which the
contents of that field are to be considered a match.
.TP
.B tags
Each tag is a list of one or more filters (defined in the
.B filters
dictionary)
that all must be matched in order for the tag to be assigned to a
new TLS session.
