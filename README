# Release Notes for ktls-utils 0.11-dev

Note well: This is experimental prototype software. It's purpose is
purely as a demonstration and proof-of-concept. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

In-kernel TLS consumers need a mechanism to perform TLS handshakes
on a connected socket to negotiate TLS session parameters that can
then be programmed into the kernel's TLS record protocol engine.

This package of software provides a TLS handshake user agent that
listens for kernel requests and then materializes a user space
socket endpoint on which to perform these handshakes. The resulting
negotiated session parameters are passed back to the kernel via
standard kTLS socket options.

See [COPYING](COPYING) for the full text of the license under which
this package is released.

## Dependencies

* The local kernel must be built with CONFIG_TLS enabled
* The local build environment requires GnuTLS and keyutils

## Installation

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions from the community.
Before submitting a pull request,
please [review our contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Work that remains:

### Required for client-side prototype

* Prototype requirements have all been met

### Nice-to have for client-side prototype

* support for using private key material stored in the local TPM
* support for session key renegotiation
* send proper SSL shutdown message when kernel consumer is finished with an endpoint
* check for the correct ALPN in the server's certificate

### Unplanned work

* support for DTLS
* support for RPC-with-TLS certificate extended key usage
* support for root device / filesystem with TLS
* support for sharing TLS sessions across sockets
* support for multiple trust chains for server verification
