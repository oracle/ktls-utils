# Release Notes for ktls-utils 0.11-dev

Note well: This is experimental prototype software. It's purpose is
purely as a demonstration and proof-of-concept. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

In-kernel TLS consumers need a mechanism to perform TLS handshakes
on a connected socket to negotiate TLS session parameters that can
then be programmed into the kernel's TLS record protocol engine.

This package of software provides a TLS handshake user agent that
listens for kernel requests and then materializes a user space
socket endpoint on which to perform these handshakes. The resulting
negotiated session parameters are passed back to the kernel via
standard kTLS socket options.

See [COPYING](COPYING) for the full text of the license under which
this package is released.
